    # Hosting a shadow DOM on a custom element
    * A custom element created by the Custom Elements API may host a shadow DOM like any other element. Consider the following example:

    # STUDY1
    * This code creates an autonomous custom element that hosts a shadow DOM. 
    
    * 1, 2 parameter 
      - first argument and a class object as its second argument
      - second argument : Keep in mind that a valid custom element cannot be a single word and must have a hyphen (-) in its name. For example, myelement cannot be used as a name for a custom element and will throw a DOMException error.
    * The class extends HTMLElement and defines the behavior of the element.
    *

    # STUDY2
    * Inside the constructor, super() is used to establish a prototype chain, and a shadow root is attached to the custom element.

<my-element></my-element>

  class MyElement extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
 
      // must be called before the this keyword
      // SUTDY2
      super();
 
      // attach a shadow root to <my-element>
      const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
 
      shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
        <style>p {color: red}</style>
        <p>Hello</p>`;
    }
  }
 
  // register a custom element on the page
  //STUDY1
  customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);
